Re-distributed here for completeness, for reference, as well as for better preservation of the original sources. 
Both original (June 1979) and revised (August 1996) NCAR reports extensively detailing the code are attached.
Present MIEV.doc (short description summarizing code features) had been converted to PDF for better compatibility.
